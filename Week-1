WEEK ! QUIZ:

1) What does h(19685) return for the following function definition?
def h(x):
    (d,n) = (1,0)
    while d <= x:
        (d,n) = (d*3,n+1)
    return(n)

ANS: 10

2) What is g(36) - g(35), given the definition of g below?
def g(n): 
    s=0
    for i in range(2,n):
        if n%i == 0:
           s = s+1
    return(s)

ANS: 5

3) Consider the following function f.

def f(n): 
    s=0
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if n//i == i and n%i == 0:
           s = 1
    return(s%2 == 1)

ANS:  n is a perfect square. 

4) Consider the following function fpp.

def foo(m):
    if m == 0:
      return(0)
    else:
      return(m+foo(m-1))

ANS:  The function terminates for nonÂ­negative n with f(n) = n(n+1)/2
